# Conditional Satements:
-   Statements that allow the computer to make decisions based on a certain condition.
-   They allow you to write programs that perform different actions depending on whether a particular condition is true or false.  

## Types:

-   1) if statement: It allows you to execute a certain block of code if a condition is true.

-   2) else statement: It allows you to execute a certain block of code if a condition is false.

-   3) Switch statement: It allows you to choose from a list of options based on the value of a variable.
 
 ## Examples:
 1) if-else statements:

## Ternary Operator:
-   The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement in C programming.
-   It takes three operands, hence the name "ternary". The format of the ternary operator is: condition ? expression1 : expression2
-   e.g:

## Switch:
-   The switch statement in C programming is a control statement that allows you to select one of several code blocks to execute based on the value of a variable or an expression.
-   The syntax of the switch statement is as follows:
