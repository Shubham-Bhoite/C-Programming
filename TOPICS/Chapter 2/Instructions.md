# Instructions:
-   These are statements in program.
-   There are 3 types:
   1) Type Declaration Instruction
   2) Arithmetic Instruction
   3) Control Instruction

## 1) Type Declaration Instruction:
-   Declare var before using it.
-   For example: if you want to declare an integer variable named "myNumber", you would use the Type Declaration Instruction "int myNumber;". This tells the compiler to allocate enough memory to store an integer value in the variable "myNumber".


## 2) Arithmetic Instruction:
-    Arithmetic Instruction is a statement that performs a mathematical operation on one or more variables. 
-    These operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-    For example: 1) subtract the value of variable "y" from variable "x", you would use the Arithmetic Instruction "x - y". 
-    2)To multiply variable "x" by variable "y", you would use the Arithmetic Instruction "x * y". 
-    3)divide variable "x" by variable "y", you would use the Arithmetic Instruction "x / y".


## 3)  Control Instruction:
-   Control Instruction is a statement that controls the flow of execution in a program.
-   These instructions are used to determine which statements are executed and in what order, based on certain conditions.
-   There are three main types of Control Instructions in C programming: Conditional Statements, Loops, and Jump Statements.
-   Foe example: 1) If you want to execute a certain set of instructions only if a variable is greater than a certain value, you would use an "if" statement.
-   2) If you want to print the numbers from 1 to 10, you could use a "for" loop.
-   3) If you want to exit a loop, you could use a "break" or "continue" statement.
