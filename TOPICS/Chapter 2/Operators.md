# Operators:
-   There are several types:
   1) Arithmetic Operators
   2) Relational Operators
   3) Logical Operators
   4) Bitwise Operator
   5) Assignment Operator
   6) Ternary Operator (Conditional)
-  Here We have learn some types:
## 1) Relational Operator:
-   Relational Operators compare two values and determine the relationship between them. The result of the comparison is always a boolean value, either true or false.
-   There are six relational operators in C:
   1) Greater than (>): This operator returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
   2) Less than (<): This operator returns true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
   3) Greater than or equal to (>=): This operator returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
   4) Less than or equal to (<=): This operator returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.
   5) Equal to (==): This operator returns true if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right.
   6) Not equal to (!=): This operator returns true if the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right.
   -  For Example:

## 2) Logical Operator:
-   Logical operators are symbols used in the C programming language to combine and manipulate Boolean expressions. 
-   A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either true or false.
-   There are three logical operators in C:
  1) AND (&&): This operator returns true if both the operands (expressions) are true. Otherwise, it returns false.
  2) OR (||): This operator returns true if at least one of the operands (expressions) is true. Otherwise, it returns false.
  3) NOT (!): This operator reverses the truth value of its operand (expression). If the operand is true, it returns false, and if it's false, it returns true.
  -   For Example:

## 3) Assignment Operator:
-   The assignment operator is a symbol used in the C programming language to assign a value to a variable.
-   It is denoted by the equals sign (=).
-   There are several types:
   1) Simple assignment operator (=)
   2) Addition assignment operator (+=)
   3) Subtraction assignment operator (-=)
   4) Multiplication assignment operator (*=)
   5) Division assignment operator (/=)
   6) Modulo assignment operator (%=)
   7) Bitwise AND assignment operator (&=)
   8) Bitwise OR assignment operator (|=)
